   What is the result of evaluating skip "abcd"?

   A: "abcd"
   B: "cd"
   C: "ac"

skip "abcd"
a skip cd
a c skip d
a c

-- Frage 2

-- last2 (x:xs) = last2 xs
-- last2 [x] = x

{-
     What is the problem (if any) with the above definition?

     A: There's no problem.
     B: Patterns (x:xs) and [x] overlap. As we first try (x:xs)
        a call such as last2 [1] reduces to last2 [] for which no match exists.
        We need to switch the order among the two function equations.

{-

     Provide for an alternative definition of tail2 that only makes use of len, head and tail.

     A: This is not possible.
     B:  
          last3 xs
